# MSDscript Description
MSDscript is an interpreter built upon a C++ that allows some mathematical expressions. MSDscript is a
simple language so far. It doesn't have subtration. It's not far from the kinds of languages that are embedded in applications. For example, someone implementing a calendar program might want to have a language for advanced users to calculate dates for repeated meetings (say, more sophisticated than “every Tuesday”), and MSDscript could just about work for that.
